## Purpose of project
The aim of the project is simply to create a program that allows a user to access two financial calculators: investment  and home loan repayment (bond).
The project is important for a financial institution that lends money to its user or provide investment opportunities for its clients.
By installing this calculator on their website, their clients  or potential clients can know exactly what the interest will be or home loan repayment as required.

## What it does
The user will choose what type of calculator they want to access - investment or bond. How the user capitalise the input should not affect the program. 
If the user doesn’t type in a valid input, an appropriate error message is displayed.
If the user chooses 'investment', the follow inputs will be required from the user: the amount you want to deposit, the interest rate, the number of years you plan on investing,
and the type of interest they want - “simple” or “compound”.
The formula is applied depending on whether the user chooses simple or compound.

If the user chooses 'bond', the follow inputs will be required from the user: the present value of your house, the annual interest rate,
the number of months the user plan to repay the bond.
The formula is applied to calculate the amount to repay each month.

## How to install code locally
Ensure you have python installed and an IDE terminal like Visual Studio Code. Dowmload the code. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory. 
Execute the script or command associated with the code you downloaded.

## How to use code once installed
Once installed, run code on python. There is a prompt to enter investment or bond. Once you entered either option, 
follow the prompt and entered required information. If you chose investment you will get at the end the 
value of simple or compound interest. If you chose bond, the final output will be the amount of bond to be repayed.
